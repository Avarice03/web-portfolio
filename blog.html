                        <h6>What is an offlaner?</h6>
                        <br>
                        <p>Offlaner is one of the roles in the online game <strong>Dota 2</strong>. Dota 2 or Defence Of The Ancients 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). It is a game played between two teams with five players each. 
                        The match is played by 10 persons which controls their individual heroes with different roles.  Generally, these roles in Dota 2 are classified in 5 positions to make a good team composition. These positions are:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Carry (Position 1)</li>
                            <li>Mid (Position 2)</li>
                            <li><strong>Offlane (Position 3)</strong></li>
                            <li>Soft-Support (Position 4)</li>
                            <li>Hard-Support (Position 5)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <!-- ROLE OVERVIEW -->
                        <h2>The offlane role</h2>
                        <p>The offlane role or position 3 is usually described among these names: <strong>the hard lane, the suicide lane, the masochist lane.</strong>
                        As an offlaner, your heroes usually should be <em>tanky, durable, and can set important plays.</em> It is one of the hardest roles in Dota since 
                        you usually take up most of the damage from the enemies and should still manage to come up on top (or at least be the reason to win a clash). Playing 
                        the offlane role can really be frustrating since you need to create space for your team and endure the lane even if your support (position 4) leaves and 
                        helps the other lanes. This means that you will usually be in a 1v2 or even 1v3 situations where 2 or more enemies are trying to kill you. But even with these
                        challenges, an offlaner should have a lot of patience and try to have a clear mindset to win the game. That's why personally, I call the offlane as a masochist lane.

                        <!-- PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -->
                        <h2>Me as an offlaner</h2>
                        <p>You probably know as of now, I'm playing Dota 2 as an offlaner. I admit that there are so many times I get frustrated while playing because of the hardships
                            of an offlaner. But still, it is very fun since you will feel hyped for some moments especially when you win a clash because of your godly sets. I'm having fun
                            playing as an offlaner since you will get a lot of positive feedback when you initiate and win a team fight. However, there will also be a <em>lot</em> of pressure
                            for you since the outcome of a team fight you initiated depends on your actions. The most annoying sensation for me is when I'm facing 2 enemies while being alone 
                            since my support went to gank other lanes. As my teammate have said "my purpose is to tank for my pos 4 to shine" even if it should have been the other way around.
                            It is annoying since even if I'm having a hard time, I should endure and take it as a grown man since I'm also aware that these hardships comes with the role as an offlane. 
                            If you will decide to play the offlane role after reading this, stick with it and enjoy the experience as you improve as an offlaner.
